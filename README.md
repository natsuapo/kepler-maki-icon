# kepler-maki-icon

The file includes extra icons for the adpated Kepler.gl version.

The original repo is https://github.com/mapbox/maki and this repo follows the same license of original maki. 


~~Currently there are still some icons that are not corectly generated, on considering how to modify them.~~

~~Seems that Kepler.gl using triangulation for generating svgs. Maybe it is not adaptable directly. It should be the main reason that kepler still cannot add customized icon.~~


Update: the new version has sucessfully made the triangluated icons that can directly utilized in [enhanced kepler](https://natsuapo.github.io/keplerjis/). 

Examples: 
- Horse-rider

I will organize and prepare the docs on how to build it in original Kepler source later.
